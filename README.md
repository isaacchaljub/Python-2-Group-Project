This repository contains a financial tool web app that allows users to visualize historic data from the company they select,get the latest information available (to us) from any company, get a P&L analysis based on selected start and end dates of a company they choose, use Predictions page to visualize how our model fares against real-life values for a selected time-window, and get a one-day forecast and recommendation for a stock using our trading tool that suggests which strategy to follow.

The app is organized using a Hello page that welcomes them, and four pages that allows them to navigate the functions we developed to play around with financial data.
